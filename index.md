<p align="justify">Welcome to the Poonawala Lab website. Our lab aims to develop automated algorithms that robots use to design provably safe controllers for unseen environments using data, without human intervention. Current algorithms that provide all three features (provably safe, data-driven, human-oversight-free) in their controllers are highly application specific. We believe that expertise in machine learning, dynamics, control theory, and artificial intelligence is critical to developing more general algorithms.</p>

<p>Our current work focuses on robot navigation and manipulation. More information can be found on our <a href="{{site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/research/" > research </a> page.</p>

[//]:<p>Robotics and control experts have designed several algorithms to solve problems in this area (deep reinforcement learning, feedback linearization, model predictive control), however they rely on human validation in some form or the other before deployment. In deep reinforcement learning, humans have to develop a sensible reward function and validate the trained object, largely due to issues of reward hacking. In more control theoretic approaches, the human has to specify a Lyapunov function that proves system properties, or a control Lyapunov function that will yield the right control.</p>
