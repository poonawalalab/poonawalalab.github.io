<h2>Control of Quadrotor Motion</h2>
<p>During my Ph.D, I had access to a quadrotor made by Quanser. My colleague Aykut Satici and I wanted to make it fly just for fun, but the quadrotor kept drifting sideways when we commanded the quadrotor to hover. Trying to fix this phenomenon led to a paper on robust feedback linearization techniques applied to a quadrotor to overcome modeling errors.</p>
