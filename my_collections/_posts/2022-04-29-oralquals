Benton Clark and Pouya Samanipour both passed their oral qualifying examinations. Congratulations!

Benton plans to investigate system identification methods for robotic mechanisms that are safe and practical despite lacking any information about the mechanism.

Pouya plans to investigate methods to synthesize provably stable and safe controllers for learned dynamical systems using Lyapunov functions parametrized as neural networks.
