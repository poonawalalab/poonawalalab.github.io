Hasan Poonawala together with collaborators from the Department of Mechanical Engineering received a grant from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) to work on multi-scale data-driven modeling of radiative transport through Thermal Protection Systems.

Our lab will contribute to the modeling process by developing self-supervised learning algorithms that enable model transfer across scales.
