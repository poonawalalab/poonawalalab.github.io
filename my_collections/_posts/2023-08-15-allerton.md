Pouya Samanipour gave a talk titled "Automated Stability Analysis of Piecewise Affine Dynamics Using Vertices" at this year's Allerton Conference in Illinois. He discussed two new methods to refine partitions when searching for piecewise affine Lyapunov functions. These new methods outperform the existing longest-edge based refinement method borrowed from computer graphics.
