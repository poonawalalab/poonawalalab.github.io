This paper, led by Christopher Dagher, presents our work on using motion planning to improve the convergence of reinforcement learning for continuous control strategies. The motion planning focuses on **contact-rich manipulation**, with an example of pushing a box over a step. Our key finding is that RL struggles to explore well, and the use of a contact-aware motion planner [(Contact-Mode Guided Motion Planning)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14431) leads to convergence for a torque-level policy.
