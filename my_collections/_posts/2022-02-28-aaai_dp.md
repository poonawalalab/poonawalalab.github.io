The paper titled "Sampling-Based Robust Control of Autonomous Systems with Non-Gaussian Noise" lead by Thom Badings (with Abate, Jansen, Parker, Poonawala, & Stoelinga) was selected as a distinguished paper at the 2022 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

The paper derives reliable goal-reaching controllers for linear systems with arbitrary process noise distributions. We can plan safe controllers for UAVs affected by wind, for example. As process noise increases, riskier (eg. narrower) paths are avoided.
