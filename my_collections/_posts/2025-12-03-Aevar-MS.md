Aevar Amundinusarson successfully defended his M.S. Thesis titled "Simulation-to-hardware validation of MPC for binary thruster 2D CubeSat control".

This thesis investigated the feasibility of MPC-based control of satellites that use binary on-off actuators for trajectory tracking during proximity operations. Aevar built a custom platform with binary actuators that glides on a flat-floor at UK, effectively recreating space dynamics in a 2D environment in a lab. His work investigated the gap between theory and practice, proposing solutions that lead to effective tracking algorithms for cubesat motion in space relative to a larger spacecraft.
