Hasan Poonawala together with collaborators from the Department of Mechanical Engineering received a grant from the Army Research Labs to work on Development of Smart Additive and Hybrid Manufacturing Systems.

Dr. Poonawala will serve as a co-investigator on the award. Our lab will contribute to AI/ML-driven process control in hybrid manufacturing (additive and subtractive) using multi-modal sensing.
