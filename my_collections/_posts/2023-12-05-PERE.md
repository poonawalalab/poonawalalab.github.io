Our paper titled "Digital Process Twins: A Modular Approach for Surface Conditioning and Process Optimization" has been accepted to the Production Engineering journal. Benton Clark is the lead on this work. 

The paper covers a new kind of digital twin that is designed for manufacturing processes. This twin combines new data-driven models of the process with optimization-based process parameters that provide superior finish properties. The modularity in this combination enables rapid extension to new materials and requirements.
