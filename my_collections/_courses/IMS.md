title: Introduction to Mechanical Systems
description: The objective of this course is to teach the fundamentals of modeling and analyzing dynamic systems, such as mechanical, electrical, thermal, and fluid systems. The first half of the semester focuses on developing ordinary differential equations to model dynamic systems. The second half of the semester focuses on ana- lyzing and solving the ordinary differential equations that describe the behavior of the dynamic systems.
prereqs: MA214, engineering standing.
