Dr. Poonawala organized a tutorial session on training and verification for learning-based control at the 2024 Modeling, Estimation, and Control Conference held in Chicago, USA. [Jun Liu](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/profiles/jun-liu) and [Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com/) gave talks about their work on Physics Informed Neural Networks and $\alpha$,$\beta$-Crown respectively. 

The talk abstracts and **slides** can be found [here](https://mecc2024.a2c2.org/tutorial-sessions/).

Special thanks to [Minghui Zheng](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/zheng-minghui.html) for chairing the tutorial sessions.
