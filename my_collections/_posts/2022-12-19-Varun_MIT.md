Visiting student Varun Hariprasad gets accepted into the undergraduate program in MIT! Varun will graduate from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, KY this Spring. 

Varun has been working on image processing for robot control using edge ML. He has also developed a distributed edge sensing network that runs deep-learning algorithms locally on edge devices and communicates relevant information to a central robot planning node wirelessly. This approach reduces network usage and provides modularity and robustness to sensor node failures.
