The paper titled "Invariant Set Estimation for Piecewise Affine Dynamical Systems Using Piecewise Affine Barrier Function" has been published by the European Journal of Control. 

The work, led by Pouya Samanipour, uses optimization and computational geometry to find invariant sets of dynamical systems.
