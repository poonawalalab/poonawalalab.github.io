## Reinforcement Learning For Dynamic Machining Process Parameters

This project is supported by the **Department of Energy**

In this work we use offline reinforcement learning to find optimal dynamic process parameters (speeds and feeds) while machining alloys.

This work pays attention to the effects of tool-workpiece interaction on workpiece quality and overall energetic costs.

### Outcomes:
1. Applied this process to TiAl and Inconel to improve productivity by more than $100$%, leading to improved profitability and lower embodied-energy.
1. Reduced the entire pipeline consisting of characterizing material to testing a dynamic processing strategy from months to weeks
